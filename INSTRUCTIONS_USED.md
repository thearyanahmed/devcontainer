# Instructions Used for Protocol-TS Project

This document contains all the instructions provided during the setup and development of this Next.js documentation site project.

## Initial Project Analysis and CLAUDE.md Creation

### Instruction 1: Repository Analysis and CLAUDE.md Creation
```
Please analyze this codebase and create a CLAUDE.md file, which will be given to future instances of Claude Code to operate in this repository.
            
What to add:
1. Commands that will be commonly used, such as how to build, lint, and run tests. Include the necessary commands to develop in this codebase, such as how to run a single test.
2. High-level code architecture and structure so that future instances can be productive more quickly. Focus on the "big picture" architecture that requires reading multiple files to understand

Usage notes:
- If there's already a CLAUDE.md, suggest improvements to it.
- When you make the initial CLAUDE.md, do not repeat yourself and do not include obvious instructions like "Provide helpful error messages to users", "Write unit tests for all new utilities", "Never include sensitive information (API keys, tokens) in code or commits" 
- Avoid listing every component or file structure that can be easily discovered
- Don't include generic development practices
- If there are Cursor rules (in .cursor/rules/ or .cursorrules) or Copilot rules (in .github/copilot-instructions.md), make sure to include the important parts.
- If there is a README.md, make sure to include the important parts. 
- Do not make up information such as "Common Development Tasks", "Tips for Development", "Support and Documentation" unless this is expressly included in other files that you read.
- Be sure to prefix the file with the following text:

```
# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.
```
```

**Result**: Created `CLAUDE.md` with Next.js architecture overview, development commands, and key project insights.

## DevContainer Setup Instructions

### Instruction 2: DevContainer Implementation
```
This file contains detailed steps for setting up a .devcontainer folder in this project.

Before taking any action:
    1.    Carefully read and understand the entire document.
    2.    Pause and create a clear, step-by-step plan based on the instructions below. Do not start creating files or directories until you've outlined this plan.
    3.    Share your plan with the user for review and confirmation.
    4.    Only after approval, proceed to implement the .devcontainer setup.

If any step seems ambiguous or incomplete, ask clarifying questions before proceeding. Accuracy and alignment are more important than speed.

This document provides systematic instructions for LLM agents to automatically analyze any repository and generate a complete DevContainer setup for local development. Supports **Node.js**, **Python**, and **Go** projects with automatic database detection and configuration.

## Core Objectives

1. **Analyze repository structure and technology stack**
2. **Detect databases and services automatically**
3. **Generate DevContainer configuration files**
4. **Ensure zero impact on production code**
5. **Handle port conflicts and environment variables**
6. **Support DigitalOcean service integration**

---

## Phase 1: Repository Analysis and Technology Detection

### Task 1: Project Structure Analysis

**Execute these commands to understand the repository:**

````bash
# Get repository overview
find . -maxdepth 3 -type f -name "*.md" -o -name "README*" | head -10
ls -la

# Check for common project indicators
ls -la package.json yarn.lock pnpm-lock.yaml  # Node.js
ls -la requirements.txt setup.py pyproject.toml Pipfile  # Python
ls -la go.mod go.sum main.go  # Go
ls -la docker-compose.yml Dockerfile  # Existing containerization
```

**Result**: 
- Analyzed repository structure and identified Next.js project with TypeScript
- Detected Node.js project using npm (package-lock.json present)
- No databases or external services found (static documentation site)
- Created comprehensive DevContainer setup plan
- Implemented `.devcontainer/` folder with:
  - `devcontainer.json` - Main configuration
  - `Dockerfile` - Custom development environment
  - Pre-configured VS Code extensions for Next.js development

---

### Instruction 3: Documentation Creation
```
Now add instructions on how to run, change and maintain the dev container in DEVCONTAINER.md
```

**Result**: Created comprehensive `DEVCONTAINER.md` documentation including:
- Quick start guide with prerequisites
- Development commands and workflows
- VS Code extensions configuration
- Troubleshooting section for common issues
- Customization instructions
- Maintenance guidelines
- Port configuration details

---

## DevContainer Configuration Fix

### Issue Resolution: Duplicate Mount Point Error
**Error encountered**:
```
docker: Error response from daemon: Duplicate mount point: /workspaces/protocol-ts
```

**Root cause**: Conflicting mount configurations in `devcontainer.json` where both `workspaceFolder` and explicit `mounts` were specified, causing duplicate mount points.

**Solution applied**:
1. Removed redundant `mounts` array configuration
2. Removed duplicate Tailwind CSS extension from extensions list
3. Kept only the standard `workspaceFolder` configuration for automatic mounting

---

### Instruction 4: Documentation Archive
```
Can you write a new doc, INSTRUCTIONS_USED.md and paste all the instructions I've gave you so far for this project?
```

**Result**: This document (`INSTRUCTIONS_USED.md`) containing all instructions and outcomes from the project setup.

---

## Summary of Deliverables

### Files Created:
1. **`CLAUDE.md`** - Repository guidance for future Claude Code instances
2. **`.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`** - DevContainer main configuration
3. **`.devcontainer/Dockerfile`** - Custom Node.js 20 development environment
4. **`DEVCONTAINER.md`** - Comprehensive DevContainer usage documentation
5. **`INSTRUCTIONS_USED.md`** - This documentation file

### Key Features Implemented:
- Complete DevContainer setup for Next.js development
- VS Code integration with 9 pre-configured extensions
- Node.js 20 LTS environment with TypeScript support
- Automatic dependency installation
- Port forwarding for development server (3000)
- Enhanced terminal with Zsh and Oh My Zsh
